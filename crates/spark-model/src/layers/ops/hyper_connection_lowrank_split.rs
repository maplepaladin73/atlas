    // untouched, so the FP32 accumulation order is IDENTICAL and the output is
    // bitwise unchanged — which is the whole point. Two kernel-side fixes were
    // measured first and both failed one half of that: warp-per-dim with a
    // shfl reduction was +17.8% but reassociates, and shared-memory staging
    // was bit-exact but 44% slower. The layout was the only thing that could
    // give both.

    // rank-320 `low` vector into its own shared memory first, and at block 32
    // that is 80 blocks each paying the same staging cost for 32 threads of
    // work. The extra SMs do not pay for the extra staging. rsafier's original
