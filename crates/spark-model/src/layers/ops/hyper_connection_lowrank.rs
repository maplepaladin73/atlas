//! Qwen3.8-Flash-Next low-rank mHC dispatch.
//!
//! Companion to `hyper_connection.rs`, which drives DeepSeek-V4's Sinkhorn
//! mixer. Both families share the `[T, hc_mult, H]` FP32 highway and the same
//! four kernel NAMES — a model shadow overrides the whole
//! `hyper_connection.cu` file, so `qwen3.8-flash-next` resolves
//! `hyper_connection::hc_pre` to the low-rank kernel while
//! `deepseek-v4-flash` resolves it to the Sinkhorn one. The two take
//! DIFFERENT argument lists, which is why the launches live apart.
//!
//! `hc_expand` is byte-identical across both and is not duplicated here.
//!
//! Selection is by WEIGHTS, not by model name: `HcSiteWeights::lowrank`
//! being `Some` is what routes here. A model that somehow carried both would
//! be a load-time bug, not a silent dispatch coin-flip.
